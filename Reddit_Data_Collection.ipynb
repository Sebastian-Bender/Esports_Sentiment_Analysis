But devoting every ounce of your life to that game, regularly playing or studying the game for 70, 80 hours a week and occasionally seeing all your hard work crumble because of meta changes or just the nature of competition... it's tough.

      "Thing is, that efficiency matters less each recall. 360 hp is a much larger proportion of your health pool at level 1 than that 200 hp will be at Level 6, especially if you pick up any item with health. You're sacrificing that initial health pool to get scaling value that is going to become irrelevant very quickly. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let's say you're playing Caitlyn, with 580 HP at level 1. 3 health pots represents an increase of 62% on your effective health pool, while refillable is 34%. Then let's say you recall at level 5, that refillable gets you another 22% on 910 HP. Recall and come back at level 7, and it's 18% of 1098 HP. Every time you refill it, the value drops because you're a higher level.\n",
      "\n",
      "You're still technically getting much greater value from it, but it's not as straightforward as the gold efficiency will imply, because what that gold efficiency actually represents is a much smaller amount of value. So damage is increasing, and keep in mind that in the early levels burst is lower, so you're more likely to have an opportunity to use those pots. Healing 200 HP over 24 seconds is not going to save you from a Leona all-in at level 6, or Zed trying to dive you at level 10, but you're going to get definite value out of 3 pots before then because you shouldn't be dying in a single trade in early laning phase. The only way refillable seems worth it to me is if you expect to recall very early with TP, or if you're really sure you don't expect to need that extra 160 HP in the early levels. And given 160 HP can be the difference between killing someone and dying, or allow you to nab a few extra CS under harass, I'd much rather take that than the negligable scaling you get from refillable in most situations. \n",

      "Edit: Or I guess if you rush armour/MR in a given matchup, given it increases the value of any source of health that you have. But if you're rushing armour chances are you're not having a good laning phase and probably needed that larger health pool anyway. \n",

      "I'm well aware of that, I'm casting doubt on the accuracy of the patch note, insofar as it explains the priority system. As I see it, there are three different scenarios that result in this outcome, assuming priority is given when the number of players queued for a specific role is smaller than the others. \n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, all four fillable roles are at an equal baseline \"supply\", and the changes in priority are just natural variation. Thing is, I find this very difficult to believe. We already know that mid lane's playrate is divergent enough to essentially remove it entirely from the priority system; but if one lane is able to have such a different playrate, it's unlikely that the other roles, with their vastly different playstyles, are so perfectly balanced in playrate that the natural variation of a population in the millions is enough to tip the scales. We'd basically have to argue that the non-mid population is evenly split 25%-25%-25%-25%. Which is outlandish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, there are factors at play that ensure that support players queue up at a different time to top players, and so forth. I can only play in the evenings, and I've still seen variation within a couple of hours, which doesn't support the idea that the different waves of players associated with different times are the cause for the variation. I haven't gotten to the point that I give enough of a fuck to actually chart changes over different days, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, Riot's added some sort of randomness or has otherwise weighted the priority system. I can't imagine any practical reason for doing this, but assuming the other two scenarios aren't viable explanations, what else is there?\n",
      "That's good news, thanks.  Wanted to focus on a few rather than spreading myself too thin\n",
      "Awesome, thanks!  Yeah I like being able to play aggressively and having big ults to impact team fights.  That said I feel like I'm lacking some proper enchanter/mage options - will give Lulu and Zyra a shot.\n",

All 4 Korean teams get through. Possibly all 4 Chinese too, don’t see 100T or CFO beating RNG. TES or EDG are the two most likely to bomb out, but I don’t think C9 match up to EDG well stylistically. EDGs botlane isn’t FBI/Huhi or some shit, and C9 seem reliant on Berserker, which works in NA cause of how bad the botlanes are besides their own.\n",
